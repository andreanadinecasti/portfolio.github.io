## 👋 Hi, I'm Andrea

I'm a Software Engineer and HCI researcher passionate about building reliable systems, intuitive interfaces, and playful XR experiences. I enjoy working across the stack — from low-level C and POSIX threads to Python data pipelines, backend APIs, and Unity AR development.

My work blends **systems programming**, **data analysis**, and **immersive tech**, with a focus on creating tools and experiences that support real communities.
